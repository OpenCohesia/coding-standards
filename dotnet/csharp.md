## C# Coding Standards and Guidelines
1. General Guidelines
  - Use PascalCase for class names, methods, and properties.
  - Use camelCase for private variables, method parameters, and local variables.
  - Interfaces should start with 'I' (e.g., IRepository).
  - Constants should use all uppercase letters with underscores (e.g., MAX_VALUE).
  - Use meaningful and descriptive names.

2. Formatting and Style
  - Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
  - Curly braces {} should be on new lines.
  - Use explicit access modifiers (private, public, etc.).
  - Remove unused namespaces and sort them alphabetically.
  - Keep lines shorter than 120 characters for readability.

3. Best Practices
  - Avoid magic numbers and strings; prefer constants or enums.
  - Use expression-bodied members when concise.
  - Avoid deeply nested conditional statements (prefer early returns).
  - Write clear XML documentation comments for public methods and classes.
